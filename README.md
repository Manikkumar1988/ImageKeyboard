# ImageKeyboard
This sample demonstrates how to write an keyboard which sends rich content (such as images) to text fields using the Commit Content API.

# Getting Started
This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Note: After installing it, you will need to enable this app as a keyboard by navigating to Settings > Languages & Input > Virtual Keyboard > Manage Keyboards. This keyboard can then be accessed by pressing the virtual keyboard icon in the lower-right hand corner of the display while in a text field.
